## Difference between Bootstrap Project and React.js Project?

These projects differ for various reasons explained below:

- The react.js project features more media queries which creates an extensive responsive design that will appease users on different devices.

- The Bootstrap primarily focused on the use of JavaScript syntax to create the funactionality of the shop page. The react.js project will utilize Redux and the store.js to create most of the shop features such as the cart.js.
